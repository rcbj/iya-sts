// File: consent_screen.js
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PASS THE MOCK STS'S CONSENT SCREEN. One implementation, shared by every job
// in this suite that signs a person in to that service and then expects an
// OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect authorization response.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Since 2026-09-01 the mock's authorization endpoint asks before it issues. The
// FIRST time a given username signs in to a given `client_id` for a given
// scope, `/oauth2/consent` is drawn and nothing is issued until somebody
// presses Allow — `oauth2.consentRequired`, which is ON by default and is the
// one policy in that service that is. Every flow in this suite therefore has
// one more hop in it than it had the day before, and the hop is in the middle
// of a redirect chain that most of these jobs walk by hand.
//
// It is a MODULE rather than fifteen copies of the same four lines for the
// reason `sts_applications.js` is: fifteen copies is fifteen chances to write
// the wait wrong, and a job that got it wrong would fail with "no code in the
// redirect" — a sentence that names the token endpoint for a problem that is a
// button nobody pressed.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO SURFACES, BECAUSE THIS SUITE DRIVES THAT SERVICE TWO WAYS.
//
//   * `settleAuthorization()` — for the jobs that follow redirects THEMSELVES
//     with `redirect: "manual"`. It walks the hops that stay on the mock's own
//     origin (the authorization endpoint, the consent screen) and hands back
//     the first one that leaves — which is the client's `redirect_uri`, the
//     thing those jobs were reading before this screen existed.
//
//   * `passInBrowser()` — for the Selenium jobs. It looks for the Allow button,
//     presses it if it is there, and returns quietly if it is not.
//
//   * `passAllInBrowser()` — the same thing until there are no more screens.
//     A FEDERATED sign-in meets two of them (the far realm's and the near
//     realm's) and a caller that cannot know which it is should use this one.
//
// **NEITHER OF THEM ASSERTS THAT THE SCREEN APPEARED**, and that is deliberate
// rather than lax. A scope under `oauthGlobalConsent`, a username that has
// consented before in the same run, and `oauth2.consentRequired` turned off are
// all states in which the screen correctly does not appear — and a helper that
// insisted on it would make every job here also a test of the consent feature,
// failing in fifteen places for one reason. What tests the screen itself is
// `sts/tests/vendored/sts_consent.js`, which asserts it appears, asserts what
// is on it, and asserts what happens when it is refused.
//
// **THEY DEFAULT TO ALLOW.** A job that wants the refusal asks for it
// explicitly, because Deny ends the flow with `access_denied` and every caller
// here is in the middle of something it expects to finish.

// the answer is known immediately; a URL inside it is a hop still in flight and
// is worth waiting on.
//
// It is deliberately GENEROUS. A federated sign-in goes out through
// /federation, comes back through an ACS and only then meets the consent
// screen, and a set that named only /oauth2 would give up in the middle of that
// and report no screen where there was one — which is a failure two steps

// federated hop — /federation/login on the way out and /federation/acs on the
// way back, where the near realm redeems what the far realm issued before it
// draws its own screen.
//
// /federation/acs IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING, and its absence is what took
// the OIDC/OIDC/password point of the grid on 2026-09-03T08-01-08. A federated
// sign-in draws TWO consent screens — the far realm asks whether the near realm
// may act for this person, then the near realm asks whether the application may
// — and between them the browser waits at /federation/acs while the near realm
// redeems the code over a back channel. Past the four-second window that URL
// was not recognised as mid-leg, so passInBrowser() returned false,
// passAllInBrowser() stopped, and the near realm's screen was left standing.
